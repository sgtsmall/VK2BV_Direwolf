# VK2BV_Direwolf
Scripts and documentation to build Direwolf Raspberry Pi iGate-Beacon-Digipeater-TNC
This Github entry is not finalised... stuff is still all over the place.




## Overview
*   Using most Raspberry Pi's with a USB soundcard and GPIO based adapter board create a TNC that can support several APRS functions

*   Note for these projects I use and recommend a SoundBlaster Play USB (original) I haven't tried the Soundblaster Play 2 yet but I expect it to work.
*   I have also had success with some early Logitech Headset USB adapters.
*   I have had nothing but trouble with $1,2,5,6 ebay adapters. They work perfectly on PC's but not so much on Linux and particularly ARM based units like RasPi.

*   My common setup with this is a Raspi B+ with the soundcard and 
  *       UV-5R and purpose built cable to support Audio In/Out and PTT. To power it I use an Ebay 12+V to 5V USB adapter module and the battery eliminator module for the 5R.
  *       Yaesu/iCom Mobile Rig with 6 pin data cable to support Audio In/Out and PTT.
