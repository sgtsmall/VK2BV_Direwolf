VK2BV Direwolf - Build Full Image

 

# Build the Full Image

This document covers the Full image. It assumes you have a screen keyboard and mouse attached.

There is also a lite image build (https://github.com/sgtsmall/VK2BV_Direwolf/blob/master/docs/VK2BV_direwolflite_build.md) This starts with a network based command line.

From time to time you may need to completely rebuild the image. These instructions and some scripts represent a minimal set of installs and script changes that were needed to build the image. I ended up automating several of these steps and these notes are the result. Your mileage may vary!!!

# Parts for the full image

  - Tested with Raspberry Pi 2 to Raspberry Pi 3 (Using B+ model should work, have not tested with A models or zero)'
  - 8Gb SD card
  - Display (1024x768) a seperate document will discuss smaller displays.
  - Keyboard, Mouse.
  - SoundBlaster USB Play Sound Card
  - Interface cable for your radio
  - 5V power for the Pi (initially it can be built from your PC USB, but later you will need around 2A [10W])
  - Optional
    - rPi interface board kit or the circuit can be assembled on any proto board. 
    - GPS
    - RTC

For the Full image I recommend an 8Gb SD card (although 16Gb is fine)

I strongly recommend a Pi 3 here, the performance makes the experience much better.

If you are buying new then get a Pi 3. Note that Pi 3 has some issues with the way they have developed the bluetooth and some other components that make them not 100% compatible with more common Pi Hats, however this should not be a problem here.

Source for full image:

choose the raspbian full image.
or use the NOOBS build for raspbian

https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

There are several articles on how to create an image on the SD using these files.

_At this point you can build the system all plugged in. I personally do most of these steps initially via ssh because it is easier to cut and paste. I also get VNC going fairly early._

ssh software - it's builtin on most Mac and Linux. For windows 
  - Bitvise SSH Client
  - More here


For the install I am asuming you are using an ethernet connection and have reasonable internet access.

To start the process you just need the Pi plugged in.

login is: pi/raspberry

boots to sh (ssh available)

basic config stuff:


### Remove some software
This step is optional, however I currently have no need for this software and it significantly adds to the update times as the packages are very large. I'm not particularly concerned with saving the disk space just the download times.
The particular packages are the wolfram and libreoffice.
Start a terminal for these bits _Acessories/Terminal_ You may be able to do these through the WIMP's interface I'll probably find out one day! [Windows, Icons and Mouse Pointing]
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>sudo apt-get remove --purge wolfram-engine<br>
sudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice*<br>
sudo apt-get clean<br>
sudo apt-get autoremove<br>
  </tr>
</table>

### Initial Setup

You can run the raspi-config from the menu _Preferences/Raspberry Pi Configuration_ or a command line.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>sudo raspi-config</td>
  </tr>
</table>
The Raspi-config is curses menu based uses arrow, tab and enter keys. The following options are what I would suggest changing.  
  
  
    
    -   expand filesystem  
    -   Internationalization/Change locale : en_AU.UTF-8  
    -   Internationalization/Change timezone : AU/Sydney  
    -   advanced/hostname   : vkxxxpi  
    -   reboot  

After the reboot log in and we will install some software, first we refresh the repository and the system software.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>sudo apt-get update<br>
sudo apt-get upgrade<br>
sudo reboot</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now we start with some installs, from here I am using apt-get -y to avoid the confirmation prompt

### Support for soundcard, git and nslookup
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>sudo apt-get -y install libasound2-dev git-core dnsutils gawk</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### gpsd install
This next section is to support gps attached to the Pi, even if you don't have the gps you can install this now and it will build in the right bits for later.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
sudo apt-get -y install gpsd libgps-dev</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### optional git settings - not sure if these are needed
These entries may not be needed for most interactions with git so dont enter yet (unless git prompts you for the information)<br>
  - git config --global user.name â€œvkxxx"<br>
  - git config --global user.email xxx@xxx.com<br>

### Install and build hamlib 
 This is not strictly necessary unless you are dealing with a radio that uses it. But it is a good exercise of your system, if you build it now it will be available to the direwolf build.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
cd ~<br>
git clone git://hamlib.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/hamlib/hamlib<br>
cd hamlib<br>
sh autogen.sh --with-xml-support --with-python-binding<br>
make<br>
make check<br>
sudo make install<br>
sudo reboot
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Now we get direwolf

We are using some extra commands here git tab will list the versions available in the git repository, git checkout will select the one we want _currently 1.3_.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
cd ~<br>
git clone https://www.github.com/wb2osz/direwolf<br>
cd direwolf<br>
git tag<br>
git checkout 1.3<br>
make<br>
sudo make install<br>
make install-conf<br>
make install-rpi </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Note that the make install-rpi created a desktop icon for direwolf

So now direwolf is installed but not yet configured.

## todo configure gpsd
## todo configure rtc
## todo configure alsa
## todo configure direwolf
